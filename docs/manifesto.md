# 🧠 AWingDingUseCase – Manifesto  
*“This app does what your brain does: over-processes everything to say the same thing you started with.”*

## Why
Thoughts spiral.  
They encrypt themselves in anxiety, translate into glyphic nonsense, filter through half-remembered classics, then finally blurt out exactly what you meant in the first place.

AWingDingUseCase is that spiral, packaged as software.

## How It Works (in the most needlessly complicated way possible)

| Stage | What Actually Happens | Allegorical Meaning |
|-------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| 1. **Fernet Encryption** | The plaintext is AES-encrypted. | *“Better lock it away, someone might read my mind.”* |
| 2. **Wingdings Encoder** | Cipher-text is map-substituted into ✈︎☂︎♠︎ symbols. | *“Hide it behind pretty hieroglyphs.”* |
| 3. **Greeklish Filter** | Symbols are re-mapped to faux-Greek letters. | *“Make it look ancient and profound.”* |
| 4. **Cognitive Delay Sim** | Fake logs: *Reticulating splines…* | *“I’m thinking, okay?”* |
| 5. **Decryption** | Original message re-appears untouched. | *“All that work and I still just said: *`pizza is good`*.”* |
